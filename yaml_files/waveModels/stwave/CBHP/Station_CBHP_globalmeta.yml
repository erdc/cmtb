title: Cross Shore 3m Model Station
summary: >
  USACE/COAB data generated as part of the Coastal Model Test Bed(CMTB).
  The CMTB is comprised of half- and full-plane simulations while also
  utilizing a nested grid setup to model the nearshore in higher resolution.
  The different data are referred to as Regional for the parent grid while
  the nearshore, high resolution is refered to as local or nested data.
  For more information see:
  Bak, A. S., T. Hesser, J.M. Smith, and M.A. Bryant. 2016.
  Initialization and Setup of the Coastal Model Test Bed: STWAVE.
  Coastal and Hydraulics Engineering Technical Note ERDC/CHL CHETN-I-XX.
  Vicksburg, MS: U.S. Army Engineering and Research and Development Center.
